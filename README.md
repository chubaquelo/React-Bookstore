# React Bookstore (Frontend)

Magic-books Inc. is a fictional company based in Germany. We build the front-end of an application that helps to organize and manage a bookstore. They want it to be fast, dynamic and responsive to their actions and therefore we decided to build the frontend with React & Redux. We needed an API Server to manage and store the information, and for that, we have used a Ruby on Rails API server.


## LIVE DEMO

The app is deployed in Heroku.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
