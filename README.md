# React Bookstore

Magic-books Inc. is a fictional company based in Germany. We built the front-end of an application that helps to organize and manage a bookstore, according to their request. They wanted the website app to be fast, dynamic, and responsive to their actions and therefore we decided to build it with React & Redux.
